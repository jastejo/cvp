                                                     Hydrograph and Unit Hydrograph


Hydrograph shows graphical representation of discharge or flow data on the river as function of time. The discharge is plotted as Y-axis and time series data (hourly, daily or monthly basis) is presented in X-axis. Commonly, Hydrograph is used as tool to interpret the response of watershed due to rainfall events. Hydrograph composed of two components, i.e.: Surface runoff and base flow. Surface runoff represent the rapid response of the river on the watershed caused by direct surface runoff. Base flow represent the response of the river on the watershed supplied by groundwater flow and other type of flow that enter more slowly to the river streams. Estimation of base flow and direct runoff is useful to understand the hydrology of a watershed, including interaction of surface and sub-surface water
                      Base flow separation is often used to determine what portion of a streamflow   hydrograph occurs from base flow, and what portion occurs from overland flow. The surface runoff hydrograph obtained after the base-flow separation is also known as direct runoff hydrograph (DRH).
Definition of Unit Hydrograph:
It is a typical hydrograph of direct runoff which gets generated from one centimeter of effective rainfall falling at a uniform rate over the entire drainage basin uniformly during a specific duration. Effective rainfall is that portion of rainfall which fully contributes towards direct runoff. Therefore, unit hydrograph can also be defined as the hydrograph of a drainage basin which gives one centimeter of direct runoff from a rain storm of specific duration.
The main assumptions for Unit Hydrograph are following:
(i) The effective rainfall is uniformly distributed over the entire drainage basin.
(ii) The effective rainfall occurs uniformly within its specifier duration.
This requirement calls for selection of storms of so small a duration which would generally produce an intense and nearly uniform effective rainfall and would produce a well-defined single peak of hydrograph of short time base. Such a storm can be termed as “unit storm”.
(iii) The ordinates of the direct runoff hydrographs having same time base (i.e., hydrographs due to effective rainfalls of different intensity but equal duration) are directly proportional to the total amount of direct runoff given by each hydrograph. This important assumption is called principle of linearity or proportionality or superposition.
(iv) The hydrograph of runoff from a given drainage basin resulting, from a given pattern of rainfall reflects all the combined physical characteristics of the basin. In other words the hydrograph of direct runoff resulting from a given pattern of effective rainfall will remain invariable irrespective of its time of occurrence. This assumption is called principle of time invariance.
Limitations of Unit Hydrograph Theory:
 In theory, the principle of unit hydrograph is applicable to a drainage basin of any size. In practice, however, uniformly distributed effective rainfall rarely occurs on large areas. Also on large areas effective rainfall is very rarely uniform at all locations, within its specified duration. Obviously bigger the area of the drainage basin lesser will be the chances of fulfilling the assumptions enunciated above. The limiting size of the drainage basin is considered to be 5000 km2. Beyond it the reliability of the unit hydrograph method diminishes.
